Busts,Name,2022 position rank, 2022 auction price ,Notes
QB,Kyler Murray,19, $15 ,"While Kyler earned a decent 18.9 PPG, he only managed to gut out 11 games in an offense that scored in the back half of passing offense and total points. A torn ACL took him out of the season, but not before posting a mediocre 14/7 TD/INT split."
QB,Lamar Jackson,14, $17 ,"Lamar earned 20.3 PPG, but managed to play only 12 games in a bottom-5 passing offense. While his rushing was as good as ever (6.8 YPC), Lamar has only played 12 games in each of the past two seasons. "
QB,Justin Herbert,11, $19 ,"Justin Herbert played all 17 games, and matched that in PPG, merely earning 17 PPG for fantasy owners. The Chargers were a top-3 passing offense, but Herbert's ceiling was seriously limited by his lack of touchdowns. His 25 TD/10 INT ratio saw him finish 11th and not match his valuation."
RB,Jonathan Taylor,34, $66 ,"Season-killer. I can't imagine more than 1% of JT owners won their league in '22. He stunk at being available, only playing 12 games. He stunk when he played, earning only 11PPG. He stunk most of all compared to his massive valuation."
RB,D'Andre Swift,22, $52 ,"A mix of availability (missed 3 games), lack of red zone looks (only 5 TD), and a high valuation ($52) depressed Swift owners when he failed to even match his modest 2021 season. Swift only rushed for 542 yards in 2022 (compared to 617 in 2021) though admittedly was outstandingly efficient (5.5 YPC). "
RB,Javonte Williams,84, $36 ,"After a stellar rookie season, Javonte Williams suffered a torn ACL in week 4 and missed the remainder of the season. Expectations were high, and while the injury obviously was catastrophic, it's worth noting Williams didn't score a TD in the four games he played."
WR,Cooper Kupp,24, $60 ,"Looking to capitalize on a historic triple-crown 2021 season, Kupp only played 9 games with the Rams in 2022. As the highest-valued WR on the board at $60, this significantly limited his value. That said, he was the highest-scoring WR in PPG at a whopping 18.2 PPG-- a third of a point higher than Justin Jefferson."
WR,Deebo Samuel,38, $43 ,"Deebo Samuel regressed in every meaningful statistic for an offensive skill player. Games played (13 in 2022 vs 16 in 2021), yards/reception (11.3 vs 18.2), yards/carry (5.5 vs 6.2)…the list goes on. Most critically, Deebo barely earned half the yards from scrimmage as he did compared to 2021 (864 vs 1770) and experienced truly severe TD regression (5 vs 14)."
WR,Keenan Allen,42, $35 ,"Pretty simple-- only played 10 games. Keenan Allen continues to thrive on consistency. He's never been a true red zone threat and probably never will, only scoring more than 6 TDs once in his past 9 seasons. He's earned his fantasy points through playing every game and getting lots of targets and yards, so when he only played 10 games his production was curtailed. "
TE,Kyle Pitts,33, $18 ,"Despite being the 3rd highest-valued TE, Pitts had an abysmal season. He only played 10 games, but that was probably for the best-- he only caught the ball 28 times all season and only notched 2 touchdowns. Feel free to place some blame on run/pass ratio-- the Falcons were the second-heaviest run offense, trying to reduce the harm that Marcus Mariota was causing."
